This file describes how the figures were generated in the corresponding 
manuscript. Note that to get these analyses to run you will need some required 
packages in R and Python (generally loaded at the top of the corresponding 
script). You will also need to change file paths to correspond to the 
appropriate local directory.

Feel free to direct any questions to Lawrence.Uricchio@tufts.edu.

# FIGURE 1
Panel A is simply a conceptual figure. The image was made in powerpoint.

Panels B, C, and D were made in R, using simulated (C) and real (B & D) data. 
The code to make these plots is available in the file 
'plottingScripts/Fig1.New.R'  

To remake the data you can run the script 'make_example_data.sh'. 

# FIGURE 2
The analyses for this plot are found in 'plottingScripts/Fig2.New.R'. 

The corresponding data are stored in 'data/Transect_1_all.csv'

# FIGURE 3
The analyses for this plot are found in 'plottingScripts/Fig3.New.R'. 

The corresponding data are stored in 'data/Transect_1_all.csv'

# FIGURE 4
The analyses for this plot are found in 'plottingScripts/Fig4.New.R'.

The corresponding data are stored in 'data/Transect_1_all.csv'

# FIGURE 5
The analyses for this plot are found in 'plottingScripts/Fig5.New.R'.

To remake the simulation data, run 

'python setup.py install --user' 

from the top level directory (you may need to install some additional Python 
packages), and then do

'./makeTheorExpSims.sh'


# FIGURE 6
The analyses for this plot are found in 'plottingScripts/Fig5.New.R'.

To remake the simulation data, run

'python setup.py install --user' if you haven't already installed the software.

from the top level directory (you may need to install some additional Python
packages), and then do

'./run_rand_sims.sh'
